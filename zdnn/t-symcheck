# Make sure that all symbols in zdnn.h are exported by the library

# This compares the symboles exported in the header file with the
# symbols actually visible in the resulting library.  Although this
# check depends on the way symbols are exported on Linux it is still
# useful on z/OS to get notified when things are getting out of sync
# between Linux and z/OS.
